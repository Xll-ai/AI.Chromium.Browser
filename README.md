## üöÄ Key Observations
- **Initial Development**: Major costs arise from core engineering, AI integration, and adapting Chromium's 32M+ lines of code.
- **Maintenance**: Ongoing updates, security patches, and AI model refinement can be expensive.
- **Competitive Landscape**:
  - **Google Chrome**: Over **$1B annually** in development and maintenance.
  - **Microsoft Edge**: Maintains a strong presence with a more efficient team structure.
  - **Emerging Browsers** (like Perplexity's Comet): Require smart feature innovation to compete.

---

## üîç Strategic Recommendations
- **Optimize Engineering Teams**: Efficient hiring and modular development can reduce upfront costs.
- **Focus on Unique Features**: AI-driven workflow automation and contextual browsing are key differentiators.
- **Prepare for Scaling**: Investing in robust infrastructure early helps manage sudden user growth.

---

## üåê Industry Outlook
- With Perplexity AI already attracting **15M active users**, Comet‚Äôs potential success depends on achieving high efficiency in cost-to-value delivery. The AI browser space is poised for growth, with likely **3 more Secure AI Agent Browsers** emerging by the end of 2025.
